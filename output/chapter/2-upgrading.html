      <h2> Upgrading Tracks</h2>


	<h3> Upgrading from Tracks 1.6</h3>


	<p>You will need to upgrade your <code>config/environment.rb</code> with the new content from <code>config/environment.rb.tmpl</code> included in 1.7, as the format of this file has changed a bit between 1.6 and 1.7. Also, there were some database changes in Tracks 1.7, so you need to migrate to them.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Back up your existing database and installation of Tracks</li>
		<li>Install Tracks 1.7 in a new directory</li>
		<li>Copy over a few configuration files from your Tracks 1.6 directory. If using SQLite3, copy the old database into the new Tracks 1.7 directory.</li>
		<li>Rebuild your environment.rb from the updated environment.rb.tmpl</li>
		<li>Run <code>rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</code> to update your old database to the new schema&#8212;you did back up your database didn&#8217;t you?</li>
		<li>Run <code>script/server</code> inside your Tracks 1.7 directory to start up Tracks 1.7.</li>
		<li>Once you are happy that everything is working well, delete your old Tracks directory.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3> Upgrading from Tracks 1.5</h3>


	<p>There are no changes to the database between 1.5 and 1.6, but you will need to upgrade your <code>config/environment.rb</code> with the new content from <code>config/environment.rb.tmpl</code> included in 1.6, as the format of this file has changed a great deal between 1.5 and 1.6.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Back up your existing database and installation of Tracks</li>
		<li>Install Tracks 1.6 in a new directory</li>
		<li>Copy over a few configuration files from your Tracks 1.043 directory. If using SQLite3, copy the old database into the new Tracks 1.6 directory</li>
		<li>Rebuild your environment.rb from the updated environment.rb.tmpl</li>
		<li>Run <code>script/server</code> inside your Tracks 1.6 directory to start up Tracks 1.6.</li>
		<li>Once you are happy that everything is working well, delete your old Tracks directory.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3> Upgrading from Tracks 1.043</h3>


	<p>This should be a relatively straightforward, and involves the following main steps:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Back up your existing database and installation of Tracks</li>
		<li>Install Tracks 1.6 in a new directory</li>
		<li>Copy over a few configuration files from your Tracks 1.043 directory. If using SQLite3, copy the old database into the new Tracks 1.6 directory</li>
		<li>Run <code>rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</code> to update your old database to the new schema&#8212;you did back up your database didn&#8217;t you?</li>
		<li>Run <code>script/server</code> inside your Tracks 1.6 directory to start up Tracks 1.6.</li>
		<li>Once you are happy that everything is working well, delete your old Tracks directory.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Detailed steps</h3>


	<h4> Backing up</h4>


	<p>It&#8217;s very important that you <strong>back up your database</strong> before you start the upgrade process. It&#8217;s always possible for things to go wrong with the database update, and you don&#8217;t want to lose any data. If you are using SQLite3 and you are leaving your old Tracks directory in place, then you don&#8217;t need to do anything. However, there is no harm in taking extra precautions and copying your database from <code>/db</code> to a safe location as an extra backup, or making a dump of the schema and contents. You will never regret making too many backups! If you are using MySQL, make a SQL dump of your database, replacing the terms in square brackets with the correct information for your setup:</p>



<div class="UltraViolet"><pre class="blackboard"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> mysqldump –-user [user name] –-password=[password] \
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> [database name] <span class="Keyword">&gt;</span> [dump file]
</pre></div>

Rename your old Tracks installation (e.g. to &#8216;tracks-old&#8217;) so that you can install Tracks 1.7 along side it.

	<h4> Install the latest version of Tracks</h4>


	<p>There are two methods of downloading Tracks:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>(Recommended for most people) Download the <a href="http://bsag.bingodisk.com/public/files/tracks_1.7rc.zip">zipped package</a>, and unzip in your preferred location (e.g. <code>~/Sites</code> for Mac OS X users).</li>
		<li>If you want to live on the edge, you can get the latest development version from GitHub using git (bear in mind that this may be less stable than the released versions):</li>
	</ol>



<div class="UltraViolet"><pre class="blackboard"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> cd <span class="Keyword">~</span>/Sites
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> git clone git://github.com/bsag/tracks.git
<span class="line-numbers">   3 </span> cd tracks
</pre></div>


	<h4> Copy over old configuration files</h4>


	<p>There are a few files you need to copy over from your old installation. If you copy them over rather than moving them, you can still run your old version of Tracks if anything goes awry with the installation process.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Copy <code>/config/database.yml</code> from your old Tracks directory to the same location in the new one. Double check that the information there is still correct.</li>
		<li>Duplicate <code>/config/environment.rb.tmpl</code> in the Tracks 1.7 directory, and rename the file to <code>environment.rb</code>. Open the file and alter the line <code>SALT = "change-me"</code> so that it matches what you had in this file in your old installation. You may also want to change the time zone setting as appropriate for your location. If you have made any other customisations to <code>environment.rb</code> in the past, copy those over, but the contents of the file have slightly changed since 1.5, so check it carefully.</li>
		<li>Copy your <code>/log</code> directory over from your old installation to the root of the new one, or just rename <code>/log.tmpl</code> to <code>log</code> to start afresh.</li>
		<li>If you are using SQLite3, copy your database from <code>/db</code> in your old Tracks directory to the same location in the new one.</li>
		<li>If you are using Windows, you may need to check the &#8216;shebang&#8217; lines (<code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</code>) [1] of the <code>/public/dispatch.*</code> files and all the files in the <code>/script</code> directory. They are set to <code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</code> by default. Check the format of those lines in your old installation, and change the new ones as necessary.</li>
	</ol>


	<h4> Update your old database to the new format</h4>


	<p>In a terminal, change directories so that you are inside the Tracks 1.7 directory. Then issue the command to update your Tracks 1.6 database to the format required for Tracks 1.7:</p>



<div class="UltraViolet"><pre class="blackboard"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> rake db<span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>migrate</span> <span class="Variable">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="Keyword">=</span>production
</pre></div>


	<p>Watch the output carefully for errors, but it should report at the end of the process that everything worked OK. If you do get errors, you&#8217;ll have to fix them before you proceed any further. Running rake with the <code>--trace</code> option can help to track down the problem.</p>


	<h4> Start the server</h4>


	<p>If you&#8217;re still in the Tracks 1.7 root directory in a terminal, enter the following command to start up Tracks in production mode:</p>



<div class="UltraViolet"><pre class="blackboard"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> script<span class="Keyword">/</span>server <span class="Keyword">-</span>e production
</pre></div>


	<p>Visit the URL indicated by the output (e.g. <code>** Mongrel available at 0.0.0.0:3000</code>
) in a browser, and with any luck, you should be able to log in and find all your actions as you left them! If you need to access Tracks from a mobile/cellular phone browser, visit <code>http://yourdomain.com/mobile/</code>. This mobile version is a special, lightweight version of Tracks, designed to use on a mobile browser.</p>


	<h4> Clean up your old installation</h4>


	<p>Once you&#8217;re certain that your new Tracks 1.7 installation is working perfectly, you can delete your old Tracks directory.</p>


	<h3> Upgrading from versions prior to 1.043</h3>


	<p>The best option for versions prior to 1.043 is to follow the instructions below to upgrade to version 1.043, then use the instructions above to upgrade from version 1.043.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>For safety, rename your current Tracks directory to &#8216;tracks-old&#8217; or something similar.</li>
		<li>Before you do anything else, <strong>BACK UP YOUR DATABASE</strong> (tables and content) and keep the SQL dumps somewhere safe so that you can recreate the old database if necesary.</li>
		<li>Download a copy of Tracks 1.043 and unzip alongside your &#8216;tracks-old&#8217; directory.</li>
		<li>Open the file <code>config/environment.rb</code> and look at the last line which should read: <code>SALT = "change-me"</code>. Change the word change-me to something else of your choosing. This string will be used as a &#8216;salt&#8217; to encrypt your password and make it a bit more secure. Also look at the timezone setting at the bottom. You can leave it commented out if your server is in the same time zone as you, but you may need to adjust it if your server is in a different time zone.</li>
		<li>In <code>database.yml</code> insert your old database name, user and password under the &#8216;development&#8217; section. If you are using SQLite3 rather than MySQL or PostgreSQL, you need only the database name, and to change the &#8216;adapter&#8217; line to &#8216;sqlite3&#8217;. You also need to copy (NOT MOVE!), your SQLite3 database from your tracks-old <code>db</code> directory to your new tracks <code>db</code> directory</li>
		<li>Run the command <code>rake extract_fixtures</code> inside the Tracks directory. This will populate the <code>db/exported_fixtures</code> directory with <code>*.yml</code> files corresponding to the contexts, projects and todos table from the contents of your old database.</li>
		<li>Open <code>db/exported_fixtures/todos.yml</code> and search for the lines starting <code>created:</code> and replace with <code>created_at:</code>. If you are using SQLite3, you also need to change the following: <code>done: "0"</code> with <code>done: "f"</code> and <code>done: "1"</code> with <code>done: "t"</code>. You need to replace the similar &#8216;done&#8217; lines in <code>projects.yml</code>, and in <code>contexts.yml</code> replace <code>hide: "0"</code> with <code>hide: "f"</code> and <code>hide: "1"</code> with <code>hide: "t"</code>.</li>
		<li>Create a new MySQL database (named tracks1043, for example). In <code>database.yml</code> insert this new database name, user and password under the &#8216;development&#8217; and &#8216;production&#8217; sections. If you are using SQLite3, insert a new name for a database to hold your Tracks 1.043 data.</li>
		<li>Run the command <code>rake db_schema_import</code> inside the Tracks directory. This should import the upgraded schema for 1.043 into your new database.</li>
		<li> Run the command <code>rake load_exported_fixtures</code> which will import the contents of your old database from the fixtures files in <code>db/exported_fixtures</code>.</li>
		<li> If you are using Windows, you may need to check the &#8216;shebang&#8217; lines (<code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</code>) [1] of the <code>/public/dispatch.*</code> files and all the files in the <code>/script</code> directory. They are set to <code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</code> by default. Check the format of those lines in your old installation, and change the new ones as necessary.</li>
		<li> Try starting up the server with <code>script/server</code> to make sure that all your data has migrated successfully. If all is well, follow the instructions above to <a href="upgrading_1043">upgrade from version 1.043</a> to Tracks 1.6. If you need to access Tracks from a mobile/cellular phone browser, visit <code>http://yourdomain.com/mobile/</code>. This mobile version is a special, lightweight version of Tracks, designed to use on a mobile browser.</li>
